Our project aims to display the uses of topics of database systems whether for someone who doesn't know anything or someone who has worked with databases before. Throughout the semester, we'll be collaboratively working on our web application, Coogify Music - The Online Music Library, to showcase our understanding of Database System principles.

## Getting Started

 - go to ```TeamProject3380/coogify-app/backend/.env```
   - change the ```SERVER_HOST = '3.18.22.13'``` to ```SERVER_HOST = 'your host (localhost)'```
   - if you wish to use your own database, then change ```MYSQL_HOST = 'coogify-database.cj6qgki6g237.us-east-2.rds.amazonaws.com'``` to ```MYSQL_HOST = 'your database host'```
     - (if you change the MYSQL_HOST, you also need to change the MYSQL_USER, MYSQL_PASSWORD, and MYSQL_DATABASE)
 - go to ```TeamProject3380/coogify-app/frontend/src/apiConfig.ts```
   - change ```const backendBaseUrl = 'http://3.18.22.13:3001'``` to ```const backendBaseUrl = 'http://${your url (localhost)}:3001';```
 - in your terminal go into the ```./coogify-app/frontend``` folder
   - run ```npm i```
   - run ```node app.js```
 - open another terminal and go to ```./coogify-app/backend``` folder
   - run ```npm i```
   - run ```tsc && vite build```
   - run ```vite --host```
